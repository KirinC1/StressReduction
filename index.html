        <h2>The Main Way is Video Games</h2>

        <div class= "main1">
        <p>Video games are a great way for me to relieve stress. 
        The fact that we might not go back to school for the rest of the school year is daunting. </div> 
        <div class= "main2"><p>I have been spending my time playing some <u><a href= "https://minecraft.net" target="_blank">Minecraft</a></u> with some friends on a private server. And today, I started playing <u><a href= "https://animal-crossing.com/" target="_blank">Animal Crossing</a></u>
        They are both very soothing games and I feel like they definitely relieve some of my stress and take my mind off of COVID-19.</p></div>
        <div class= "main3"><p>There are many other games that I've playing during this shelter in place, but I feel like these two are the most relaxing ones and I've had the most fun playing them.</p></div>
    <div class= "forward">
        <h1>What I Look Forward To</h1>
        <p>I look forward to finally be able to go and hang out with some of my friends again. Also, it will be great when all of the non-essential stores are reopened like stores at the mall. I am also looking forward to going out to eat with my family after all of the restrictions are lowered.</p>
